# PUPPET VERSION PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
#
# Define the Puppet version as a root key, then specify the OS platform(s) and versions(s) that this Puppet version is
# compatible with AND that you wish to test on. If you wish to exclude a platform from testing, simply omit it.
#
# OS names and versions must conform to the VMPooler nomenclature and conventions.
#
# Running 'bundle exec rake 'pdksync:generate_vmpooler_release_checks[7]' will generate an entry in the 'provision.yaml'
# for each managed module that contains a configuration that satisfies both:
# - The module's compatible platforms
# - The Puppet version's compatible platforms (in this example: '7')
#
# NOTE: arch will always be assumed to be 'x86_64'
